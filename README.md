Greasemonkey plugin to preview guardian.co.uk content across different platforms and sizes

Here's how to install it for Firefox (if you want to try it in Chrome, just follow the second step).

1. Install the Greasemonkey plugin for Firefox (if not installed already) from: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/?src=ss
2. Visit this URL (https://github.com/phamann/kaleidoscope/raw/master/kaleidoscope.user.js) which should prompt you to download our code and install it as a plugin

Now when you navigate either guprod.gnl or guardian.co.uk you should see a little mobile icon in the top right corner. Click it for a preview of the current URL you're on, either on beta.guardian.co.uk, m.guardian.co.uk, or the Mobile Aggregator feed which powers our apps (this option just displays a simple running order).

Let us know about any bugs/enhancements we could make.

PS: feel free to pass this around other people
